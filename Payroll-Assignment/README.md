### Understand The Concept of Virtual Functions

  This lab consists of 3 classes. First the base class, Employee, defines 4 data members, name, id, _class and mySalary. These data member are inherited by the two derived classes, Waiter and Chef. The Employee class also defines a virtual function which is used to calculate the salary for a given employee of the derived classes. For example, the owner of the restaurant gets a base salary of $15,000 plus 60% of the monthly profit. The chefâ€™s receive a base salary $10,000 plus 20% of the base salary. The waiters receive a base salary of $3,000 plus tips. Each implementation of employee overrides the calculate salary function via polymorphism. In the program, 6 types of employees are created and added to a list of type Employee. We have created random names and ID numbers for each type of employee to show how it is displayed. The list is then iterated and the statistics of each employee is displayed based on the monthly profit of $6,000.
