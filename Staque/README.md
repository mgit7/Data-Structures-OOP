This program implements a data structure called “Staque”. The way it works is the user will be prompted a menu of options to choose from. The user will choose a letter from one of the options listed. To insert numbers into Staque, the user will be asked how many numbers they want to add to the Staque. Then the program will repeatedly ask the user to enter the number that the user wants to insert into the Staque. When the user displays the Staque, the even numbers are displayed on top while odd numbers are displayed on the bottom. The user is also able to remove numbers from the list in the order according to LIFO. When the user removes numbers, the program will ask the user how many number(s) they want to remove from the list. Then the user will be prompted repeatedly to remove either an even or odd number. The user will keep getting brought back to the main menu until the user wants to quit the program.When the user displays the Staque, the even numbers are displayed on top while odd numbers are displayed on the bottom.
