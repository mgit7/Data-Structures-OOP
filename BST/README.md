### Understand The Binary Search Tree Data Structure

In the program I implemented a binary search tree which implemented in this way: The left sub tree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the nodeâ€™s value. The right sub tree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's key. Both the left and right sub trees must also be binary search trees. Each node has a left child and right child. So as nodes are inserted into the tree, following the implementation stated above, the values will be inserted in that way. This BST structure shows that values can be added, removed, search for and displayed. We have inserted a set of static numbers and we give the user a menu of options to choose what they would like to do with the data.
